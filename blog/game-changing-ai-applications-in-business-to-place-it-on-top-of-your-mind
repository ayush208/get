                    <p>In fact, the adoption of AI in business is accelerating. Around 31% of worldwide companies are already utilizing some AI technologies and nearly 43% of them are exploring their options in the AI adoption for their business as <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBMs-Global-AI-Adoption-Index-2021" target="_blank">IBM's Global AI Adoption Index suggests.</a></p>
                    <p>That's just the beginning! Where there are big amounts of data, the use of AI is crucial. Companies incorporate artificial intelligence in business to save money, increase efficiency, get important insights and create new markets with long-lasting and unimaginable business opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Just remember “the blue ocean strategy”! That's when a business produces an innovative product or generates a novel value, thus creating a new market where competition is irrelevant. It is one of the major benefits of AI adoption in business, however, there are a few more to name.
